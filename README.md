## Introduction

Gitlab is a popular open-source software that provides users a platform for collaboration, software version control as well as Continuous Integration/Continious Delivery (CI/CD) capabilities.

## Continous Integration

Continuous Integration
- Merge frequently
- QA when code is ready
- Developer driven

Non-Continuous Integration
- Merge everything at once
- QA all of the changes at once
- Schedule and deadline driven

Automated tests are essential to CI.

## Levels of Testing

- Syntax testing and linting
- Unit and integration testing
- Acceptance testing
